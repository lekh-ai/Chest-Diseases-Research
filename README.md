## 🏥 Introduction
Coronavirus and pneumonia cause severe respiratory issues, requiring early and precise detection for effective treatment. Traditional methods rely heavily on radiologists' manual analysis of chest X-rays. This project utilizes deep learning, specifically DenseNet-201, to automate disease prediction, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used consists of chest X-ray images labeled for diseases such as pneumonia and COVID-19. Data augmentation techniques, including filtering and augmentation layers, are applied to enhance the dataset.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data augmentation using Keras ImageDataGenerator
   - Dataset filtering to remove noise and enhance image quality
2. **Model Deployment**
   - Training with DenseNet-201 for feature extraction
   - Fine-tuning the model using transfer learning techniques

## 🧪 Results
The proposed model achieves:
- **Training Accuracy**: 95.96%
- **Validation Accuracy**: Consistently high across multiple tests
- **F1-Score**: 0.95, indicating robust performance in classifying diseases

These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting pneumonia and COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

## 📌 Conclusion
The DenseNet-201-based model significantly improves disease classification accuracy, providing an automated and efficient solution for radiologists. Future work includes validating the model on larger and more diverse datasets to enhance its reliability and generalizability.
